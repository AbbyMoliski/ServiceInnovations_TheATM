        <h2>The ATM</h2>
        <p>When the first automated teller machine (ATM) debuted in 1967, it revolutionized retail banking services. This innovative self-service technology enabled customers to access their accounts, withdraw cash, check balances, and more, all without a human teller. ATMs made banking more convenient and accessible, allowing customers to access their money 24/7. Banks benefited too, enabling them to extend services beyond branch hours and geographic limitations. The ubiquitous ATM became an iconic representation of automated convenience. Today, over 3 million ATMs exist worldwide, providing an essential service that many now take for granted. The advent of the ATM demonstrated how automated, self-service technologies can transform industries by providing greater autonomy and efficiency. It reshaped banking into an on-demand service and was a major milestone in service innovations that increase customer access and satisfaction while reducing labor costs.</p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>The ATM provided 24/7 access to cash, expanding customer autonomy. By enabling self-service transactions, ATMs allowed banks to reduce labor costs while extending their reach beyond traditional hours and locations. This increased convenience and flexibility was a huge benefit to consumers worldwide.</p>

        <h2>Harms</h2>
        <p>The transition to automated tellers resulted in major job losses across the banking industry. While customers enjoyed new freedoms, many human tellers were displaced as banks adopted the more cost-effective machines. This underscores the disruptive effects automation can have on employment.</p>
